## Gameplay Description  
The player assumes the role of a taxi driver navigating an open-world city. The primary objective is to complete missions involving picking up passengers and delivering them to their destinations. Successful missions reward the player with money, which can be used to repair their vehicle or purchase new cars.

The ultimate goal is to save enough money to buy a Lamborghini, the player’s dream car. To achieve this, players will complete various missions, upgrade their vehicles for better rewards, and avoid collisions with other vehicles, which can damage their car and incur repair costs.
